Some code to run a workshop around.

### Get started

### TODO

There's a lot of stuff missing. 

* Make current shape move down during game ticks âœ…
* Borders per shape are sometimes doubled, they should not be.
* Introduce another shape.
* Shapes should have different colors, maybe inline border and background or something nice.
* Make current shape collision detect with bottom of board.
* Random shape each game start.
* Visualize the current shapes that are in queue to come next.
* Limit shape movement to game area
* Introduce difficulty, like speed
* Allow user control of current shape left and right.
* Make current shape collision detect with left and right of board.
* Allow user control of downward speed.
* Allow user control of downward instant drop by pressing space.
* Allow user control of current shape rotation.
* Make current shape collision detect with other shapes.
* Point system, score when rows are cleared, rows are cleared given a full line and current stops moving.
* High score
* Game state persistance.
