# sirteT

Some code to run a workshop around.

### Get started
```
npm i
npm run start
```

### TODO

* Borders per shape are sometimes doubled, they should not be.
* Shapes should have different colors, maybe inline border and background or something nice.
* Random shape each game start.
* Visualize the current shapes that are in queue to come next.
* Make current shape move down during game ticks
* Allow user control of current shape left and right.
* Allow user control of downward speed.
* Allow user control of downward instant drop by pressing space.
* Allow user control of current shape rotation.
* Make current shape collision detect.
* Point system, score when rows are cleared, rows are cleared given a full line and current stops moving.
